What is a UART ?

Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
Very commom & simple to use!

Asynchronous means not clocked - no clock in the interface.

Device       FPGA
Tx Data --- Rx Data
Rx Data --- Tx Data

This is just an example for a possible implemntion of a UART box between a devicde and fpga. there is not a must need for both data lines, it all depdends about the deisred implemention.

The UART is a full duplex interface - which mean you can send and receive at both time.

UART Configuration Parameters
1. Since there is no clock, the reciever and the transmitter needs to agree about the baud rate(bits per second)/frequency of sending bits.
If they don't agree - the data is not valid.
2. Number of data bits is 8.
3. Parity bit which can be on/off. it is useful if you want to check the data.
4. Stop bit. 1 is used as a stop bit.
The start bit indicates data is complete, stay/return to high.
4. Start bit. 0 is used as a start bit.
The start bit indicates data is coming, transition from high to low

UART Data Stream Example

-----_____ ------   _____  -----   -----   _____   -----    ____   -----  -----
     start| bit0 || bit1 || bit2 || bit3 || bit4 || bit5 || bit6 || bit7 |stop

 1. LOOK FOR FALLING EDGE OF START BIT
 2. SAMPLE MIDDLE OF DATA BITS BASED ON THE BAUD RATE
